# Stylus-Sample-Chess
A Stylus sample theme written in CSS for the online chess sites Chess.com and Lichess.org.

## First Step : Installation of Stylus
To create and apply new themes, the Stylus navigator extension is needed. You can find it for most of the populars browsers. Here are the links : 
- Chrome : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne/related?hl=en
- Firefox : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/
- Opera : https://addons.opera.com/fr/extensions/details/stylus/

## Second Step : Upload your custom chess pieces on Imgur
To replace the chess pieces, you will have to upload them to the Imgur site (or another image hosting site, it's up to you to test). To do this:
- Go to imgur.com
- Sign-in/sign-up
- Publish your images (regardless of whether they are private or not)

## Third Step : Modification of the Sample CSS
- Make sure all your images have been uploaded
- Open the sample file
- Replace the Imgur links with those of your images
- Save, then copy (ctrl-c) all of the text.

## Fourth Step : Copying on Stylus
- Open the settings for the Stylus extension
- Create a new theme by pressing "Write a new style" 
- Paste it in the appropriate area

## Fifth and final Step : Enjoy
And here we are! Already will you ask me? Of course yes, it was really not complicated, isn't it ? Chess is an amazing game, now enjoy it in any style you like!
